<h1>Hello. This is a big heading </h1>
<p>Hey. p stands for <b>paragraph</b>. So this is a paragraph element.</p>
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" title="Let's go to Google">Click me! This is a link!</a>
<p> My name is: <br>Kitty </p>
<p>I will try to make another line by creating another p element</p>
<p>But, was it cool that I was able to break the line between "My name is" and "Kitty"? I just added the br in brackets to break it. </p>
